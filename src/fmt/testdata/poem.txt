Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy,
 it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude,
 it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, 
it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight 
in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects,
 always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 
Love never fails.
