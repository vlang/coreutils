Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -L, --dereference     follow links
  -f, --file-system     display file system status instead of file status
      --cached=MODE     specify how to use cached attributes;
                          useful on remote file systems. See MODE below
  -c  --format=FORMAT   use the specified FORMAT instead of the default;
                          output a newline after each use of FORMAT;
                          overrides --terse
      --printf=FORMAT   like --format, but interpret backslash escapes,
                          and do not output a mandatory trailing newline;
                          if you want a newline, include \n in FORMAT;
                          overrides --terse
  -t, --terse           print the information in terse form
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

The --cached MODE argument can be; always, never, or default.
`always` will use cached attributes if available, while
`never` will try to synchronize with the latest attributes, and
`default` will leave it up to the underlying file system.

The valid format sequences for files (without --file-system):

  %a   permission bits in octal (note '#' and '0' printf flags)
  %A   permission bits and file type in human readable form
  %b   number of blocks allocated (see %B)
  %B   the size in bytes of each block reported by %b
  %C   SELinux security context string
  %d   device number in decimal
  %D   device number in hex
  %f   raw mode in hex
  %F   file type
  %g   group ID of owner
  %G   group name of owner
  %h   number of hard links
  %i   inode number
  %m   mount point
  %n   file name
  %N   quoted file name with dereference if symbolic link
  %o   optimal I/O transfer size hint
  %s   total size, in bytes
  %t   major device type in hex, for character/block device special files
  %T   minor device type in hex, for character/block device special files
  %u   user ID of owner
  %U   user name of owner
  %V   file name with dereference if symbolic link (V coreutils only)
  %w   time of file birth, human-readable; - if unknown
  %W   time of file birth, seconds since Epoch; 0 if unknown
  %x   time of last access, human-readable
  %X   time of last access, seconds since Epoch
  %y   time of last data modification, human-readable
  %Y   time of last data modification, seconds since Epoch
  %z   time of last status change, human-readable
  %Z   time of last status change, seconds since Epoch

Valid format sequences for file systems:

  %a   free blocks available to non-superuser
  %b   total data blocks in file system
  %c   total file nodes in file system
  %d   free file nodes in file system
  %f   free blocks in file system
  %i   file system ID in hex
  %l   maximum length of filenames
  %n   file name
  %s   block size (for faster transfers)
  %S   fundamental block size (for block counts)
  %t   file system type in hex
  %T   file system type in human readable form

--terse is equivalent to the following FORMAT:
    %n %s %b %f %u %g %D %i %h %t %T %X %Y %Z %W %o
--terse --file-system is equivalent to the following FORMAT:
    %n %i %l %t %s %S %b %f %a %c %d

NOTE: your shell may have its own version of stat, which usually supersedes
the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation
for details about the options it supports.
