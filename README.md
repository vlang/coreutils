# coreutils in V

This repository contains programs equivalent to GNU
[coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/), written in the
[V language](https://vlang.io).

## Goal

Complete set of coreutils, written as closely as possible to the POSIX spec,
with as many GNU extensions as feasible.

We are looking for solid, working implementations of the commands, not 100%
1-to-1 parity, especially not quirks and unintended side-effects.

The reference implementation is GNU coreutils 8.32.

## Layout

Each command has it's own separate subdirectory under `src`, in case the
implementor wishes to create multiple `.v` files to implement a command, or add
a README.md specifically for that command.

## Developing

Please use the `common` module for command line/help handling. This will make
the command input/output consistent across the tools.

## Building

Running `make` or `v run build.vsh` will build all the programs in `bin/`.

Note: support for access to user account info (via utmp) is limited to POSIX-like platforms.
And, so, for Windows, utilities requiring utmp support (uptime, users, who, whoami) are currently
skipped during the default build process.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Please only contribute versions of the original utilities written in V.
Contributions written in other languages will likely be rejected.

When your contribution is finalized, don't forget to update the completed
count below and mark it as done in this README.md. Thanks!

**NOTE: When testing on Windows**, comparison tests are currently run against
[uutils/coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils), a Rust re-implementation of
GNU coreutils. They are not 100% compatiable. If you encounter different behaviors,
compare against the true GNU coreutils version on the Linux-based tests first.
